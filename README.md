# HSRW Open Day 2019

## Thor To Asgard 
A [python script] (/thor_to_asgard.py)  to send goal commands to TurtleBot2 in a mapped environment.
This script commands the bot to go the specified location and orientation (Asgard) wait for a prescribed time period (10 seconds) and then return to it's base (Earth).

## Maps 2019 
A collection of [maps] (https://github.com/mtc-20/openday/tree/master/maps2019) of a small labyrinth made via different turtlebots. However, these weren't accurate enough for the turtlebot to autonomously navigate effectively. 
The [new maze] (https://github.com/mtc-20/openday/tree/master/maps2019/newmaze) contains better quality maps and work quite well.
